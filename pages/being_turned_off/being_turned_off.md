**On being turned off. An A_temporalities Lab.**
 
**Through a_synchron meetings (gatherings) we will practice story-telling, go for a walk in between different times, encounter unknown matters and speculate on staying not-healthy.**

[**https://r-calc.net/beingturnedoff/**](https://r-calc.net/beingturnedoff/)

<span style="color: DarkOliveGreen">“On being turned off” was the first public lab organized within the context of our research project. It ran from the 20th to the 27th of April 2020. It became clear pretty early on that the lab would take place online-only. Since that was how many of us within the project organized ourselves anyway (with discord as our main discussion platform and meetings often taking place via jitsie and such, Zoom wasn’t that dominant quite yet back then) ideas of inviting people to a video-call was definitely something floating around. I think we all shared various frustrations with a lot of those demanding online formats. How despite going online a lot of events were still moving along meatspace-time and physical demand (maybe your familiar with the zoom-headache) so we somewhat shifted to making this a focal point of the lab: the format, and therefore the possibility of our lab taking place along different temporalities (attention span, time-demand, longevity etc.).  
The lab itself consisted of a bare-bones webpage (https://r-calc.net/beingturnedoff/) where we curated different texts/videos/images and sounds to be displayed at different times during the week. With many of the works we featured dealing in some way or another with the ominous concepts of time, touch and healthiness. So you’d open the page one day to find a youtube-lecture about how to enable a non-normalized classroom learning space and come back sometime later to a pdf about diy face-mask sewing and a music video called “Too much to touch”. With the content itself also repeating and reshuffling throughout the week.
But this is only one side of the lab, with the other being three different chat-meetups at various times throughout the week.  
Each one lasting between one to two hours, where people could joining semi-anonymously via an embedded chatango.com applet. All meetups were planned quite differently but most often we had one person facilitation the discussion within the chat and one person acting as a sort-of website-vjay (explain vjay?). With the vjay being able to add and remove videos and texts and such live from the website whilst people were watching and chatting alongside.  </span>

<span style="color: CornflowerBlue">What do you remember of the work process of how we developed and built the Un_Timely Lab, and do you find anything remarkable/noteworthy about the process?   </span>
  
<span style="color: CornflowerBlue">I remember our work process as easy, fun, harmoneous and chilled - despite the fact that there wasn’t so much time to cook up an event that in actual fact spanned an entire week. (Our lab preparation work used Discord as communication tool, of the RCAC project development  - a proprietary freeware platform often used by gamers, and suitable for our purposes because it allows for neasily communicating visual elements, and communicating via visual elements. The posts document a 4 weeks preparation period - stimmt das? der kanal beginnt am 17.3.) The tension erupted later - I think also due to the fact that the event itself was very demanding simply also timewise.  </span>

<span style="color: CornflowerBlue">If you look back, what did you like most about our lab? And what did you find most challenging?  </span>

<span style="color: DarkOliveGreen">I'd like to start with answering the second question, because unfortunately I find it easier remembering what was challenging than what I really enjoyed in our process. And I think for me one of the most challenging things was what we called chat facilitation. I remember that we all three had different curiousnesses in investigating what a chat space could be for the lab meetups. For me this was definitely just this feeling of presence. Like the little indicator at the bottom of that chat window that said "there are 10 people in this space with you"... Maybe actually that's also what I liked most about our lab! This somewhat awkward but also tranquil moment of being together. But then what to do with all those uncertainties of the chat format, that was the difficult part.  </span>

<span style="color: CornflowerBlue">That is for me very interesting to read, because i would say the same: the most challenging aspect was the chat facilitation. For me, that was a very tough learning experience. As a very [meatspace](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=meatspace) experienced facilitator I was extremely naive in underestimating how, of course, chatroom conventions shape the conversations in those spaces. In other words you can’t facilitate -- or maybe you just shouldn’t because you’re demanding too much of yourself -- in contexts where you don’t know their communication conventions at all. That was a serious case of academic over-estimation on my part, i mean, no one would ever think of facilitating a university event if they have no idea about uni contexts.  </span>
  
<span style="color: CornflowerBlue">And I already said that the lab itself, resp. its three installments, was for me very demanding, very stressfull - probably also because it coincided with the first week of the summer term semester, and that was the first semester under Covid-19-conditions, and i was still vice dean of the art school, and all of that meant that i sat in front of a computer for 14 hours every day, 7 days a week. But i also need to say that i am super proud about what we did: this project is one of the most beautiful, exciting, precise things i have ever done.  </span>

<span style="color: Coral">Hmm.. what Johanna says makes me go back to the thoughts we talked about during the preparation, that institutions for example started to use spaces in a way like claiming the spaces as theirs and they can do anything in them, as if they discovered them new for themselves, which is super problematic. I also read that games also started to be a new trend and art reviewers started to make game reviews of some popular games and they really do say “games are actually much more cooler than contemporary art”, haha, I don’t know how they can speak on ‘games’ as if it is not a huge thing and does not include a lot of crap besides the good ones. It has also its diverse community.  </span>
  
<span style="color: Coral">Thinking on what we did, I think it was very lecture-performance-like woffering space for interactivity. I think we developed our own method of doing the lab. This had its challenges of course. We could also use the academic Zoom method, which would be super safe in terms of you can control everything and you don’t count with any unexpected events. But we all weren’t interested in that, I think. With our method we managed also to get away from the frontal, self-image-based conversation and its ableism.   </span>
  
<span style="color: Coral">The facilitation or the feeling of being the facilitator was hard for me, especially to lead the conversations to a direction. I like the idea of posting one picture or text as small input once in a while and giving space for conversations to develop.   </span>

<span style="color: DarkOliveGreen">I’m excited to be reading this as I do agree wholeheartedly. Looking back it really feels like and experiment with digital forms, throwing somewhat weird things together, tweaking and seeing what resonates with people. In order to try to get away from this very brutal mapping of physical learning spaces into digital material reality. But also I wonder about how much of this came across on the other end of the screen, at the people that were with us in the chat... and like you said about facilitation, even though we tried to ease a lot into the space, giving introductions and taking time, I still got the feeling that some people were just totally overwhelmed with this (including myself often).
So I do wonder what the result of our “experiment” is, where would we go from here? Especially since we’ve now seen happen the normalization of Zoom as this catch-all environment with it’s own rules emerging (like everyone has their camera always on ;])...  </span>

<span style="color: Coral">I think, if we had much more time to expand the space between the three meetings, like if they would be spreaded in one and a half month for example, that would be something/one thing I would like to try. In academic contexts I often feel like theories being told doesn’t really convince in practice, even though they sound good. Maybe because of limitedness; limited time, limited money, limited dedications etc. In ours I see (our) tendencies to get to somewhere else but I see also the existing limitations that won’t wholly allow it.  </span>

<span style="color: DarkOliveGreen">What was it that we actually did? On the page it’s called a “lab (=laboratorium) space”? What does this mean in the context of meeting online and in the context of our research topics?  </span>

<span style="color: CornflowerBlue">\&lt;\&lt;**laboratory (n.)** c. 1600, "room or building set apart for scientific experiments," from Medieval Latin _laboratorium_ "a place for labor or work," from Latin _laboratus_, past participle of _laborare_ "to work" (see [**labor**](https://www.etymonline.com/word/labor?ref=etymonline_crossreference#etymonline_v_41652) (v.)). Figurative use by 1660s.[https://www.etymonline.com/word/laboratory](https://www.etymonline.com/word/laboratory), visited August 25, 2020). \&gt;\&gt;  </span

<span style="color: CornflowerBlue">The term ‘lab’ is application rhetorics, i.e. was chosen by us while writing the research grant application. For me, while writing, I liked the term as it denotes a context of experimentation, where people come together and try things out - and are invited to be participants in this try out  (versus being listeners/viewers to or of something that has been prepared beforehand.) In retrospect i wonder, was it Antragskitsch? For our specific project, other terms might have been more apt. (Let me go look...)  </span

<span style="color: DarkOliveGreen">Hehe, I really find it interesting in your laboratory definition qoute that it says "room or building", and then we're talking about a webpage. It gives it this *skeuomorphic* quality. like calling the ZOOM interface and infrastructure a "digital classroom"...  
(but then again, I’ve also just written in another part that I like “10 people are in this space with you”) ...  </span>

<span style="color: Coral">I liked that very much too.  </span>

<span style="color: Coral">Lab sounds for me like something where everyone can join and do stuff, actually I was chemistry fan as I was younger and I loved playing with the small tubes etc. so to me it is connected with trying things out firstly, but then the contexts in which it is used, e.g. in art contexts, it assumes to be something related with science, which doesn’t fit many times, and also maybe a strategy for getting funds?  </span> 

<span style="color: CornflowerBlue">\&lt;\&lt;Skeuomorphism has been a very useful concept in design, then it became the most hated concept in design, and then it came back from the dead. ... Skeuomorphism is where an object in software mimics its real world counterpart. The “trash can” is, perhaps, the most recognizable skeuomorphic object. Though the good old “save” icon was once skeuomorphic but following the demise of the floppy disc – it no longer bears resemblance to the world of [https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/skeuomorphism-is-dead-long-live-skeuomorphism](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/skeuomorphism-is-dead-long-live-skeuomorphism), visited August 25, 2020) </span>

![Description of image here](/img/screen.png)

<span style="color: DarkOliveGreen">It also makes me wonder about the design of our lab page... How did this come together? It has this almost “meta-morphic” aspect to it, it functions as a minature desktop (with elements to drag around) inside your actual desktop.  </span> 

<span style="color: Coral">That is interesting, a quote from the same page,</span>  
<span style="color: BurlyWood">“That trash can let users drag stuff they didn’t want on their computers to an actual bin. You could move files to folders (another real life equivalent).”  </span>  
<span style="color: Coral">And then talks about the ‘affordance’, means kind of that an object telling you what to do with it. In our page we had these draggable objects but there isn’t any move which tells you to do something, so you are free to move, but without any specific goal, I like that actually, maybe it could have gone a bit further even. Time or better untimely aspect relates to this too, I think.  </span> 

<span style="color: DarkOliveGreen">What is the significance of “different times” and “a_synchronicity”?</span>

<span style="color: CornflowerBlue">In order to cater to different temporal needs and realities, we created a structure of presentation where different elements followed different temporal logics, or even, where participants could determine their own viewing and reading pace.</span>

<span style="color: CornflowerBlue">Persson Perry Baumgartinger, when he taught a project in Kassel, said that in his experience slowing down is the most useful tool for creating anti-ableist learning contexts. In our project, this became painfully clear - if someone goes too fast, they lose parts of the research group — and this kept happening in the beginning. Also, i think i have never before been made so aware of how different needs are with regard to taking one’s time or enjoying being speedy, and how these different temporal needs create their own physical/material reality. So we slowed down. (I am a fast reader, a fast talker, and i type fast - in order to stop being fast while in the lab’s chat installments, i started to sit on my hands  in front of the computer, and i bit on my tongue. So yes, this was quite painful at times.) </span>

<span style="color: CornflowerBlue">Ours and other people’s work used during the three lab installments:</span>

![Description of image here](/img/code.png)

<span style="color: CornflowerBlue">Should we pay for using other people’s work, we wondered, and we discussed whose work we should pay for. (There was no money for this kind of expense: according to the rules of grant giver VW Stiftung the research project cannot pay honorary fees; if money was needed we had to scrounge money from elsewhere.) Our decision was that work presented online on large platforms can be quoted or referenced but work given to us via permission by freelance artists needed to be remunerated with at least a symbolic amount of money. </span>

<span style="color: DarkOliveGreen">Oh!! This, for me, is such a fuzzy but really important territory! I remember that we had lots of discussions regarding quoting, embedding, crediting and such, with even just one of the aspects being honorarium. From my experience with festivals and freelance work this is always so arbitrary and hush-hush. I feel kind of good that we payed something at least but drawing that line feels somewhat bad in retrospect. I’m sitting here wondering if I should write down our budget... was it 200 € or something? With the VW Stiftung project grant being a total of 200.000 € just to put some perspective on this. Maybe we’ll redact this afterwards because it does feel somwhat disrespectful towards the artists. It just wasn’t enough budget even though we tried. And I think there is a longer discussion we could (an should?) have here with regards the different realities between academic quoting and artist/screening fees. Especially when talking about different media (film, images, code, music and of course text) and especially-especially when talking about online spaces and presentation forms.</span>

<span style="color: CornflowerBlue">Yes! But i would also like to add that to my knowledge there is no such thing as a screening fee for academic texts - so imagine what this means, materially, as a matter of fact, for theorists that try to survive as freelancers resp in work conditions that are ‘prekarisiert’ - and that are ‘prekarisiert’ ever more progressively, as ever more theorists and academics work under ‘prekarisierten Arbeitsbedingungen’. So one of the criteria for me was, precisely not is this an academic or an artist - but can i find out if the person whose work we quote / use has a job that gives them a regular income, or was the particular work produced under fair working conditions i.e. had people been paid while producing a work that we would then use/show/quote (i actually think, ‘quoting’ is a technically misleading term for what we did with other people’s productions). </span>

<span style="color: Coral">I think that is a good point, to consider the circumstances in which the work was produced. I consider this also in music or any other kind of art form, I am coming to the point on which we had arguements, but just passing by :)
If it is already produced by a person from a priviledged position, then I don’t feel like I have to give this person credits, it goes to the direction of defending copyrights to me and I disagree with that at this point. </span>

![Description of image here](/img/copyright.png)

<span style="color: Coral">And the artist fees (screening fees) are almost non-existent for usual artists, if you are not very succesful already, so like the academic quoting, it is just a cultural capital which enables exploitation. It feels weird to be in that position of the organizer, but I think it was quite OK what we did considering the fees.</span>

<span style="color: Coral">The time when we made this workshop, it was the beginning of pandemic, now we are more like in the middle, I think in that short time we managed to pick up some essential issues like staying not healthy etc. What would you do it otherwise when we did it now, or what do you think has changed meanwhile (if at all) ? </span>

<span style="color: DarkOliveGreen">I would kind of like to ask the participants of our three lab meetups this questions. Back in April I got the feeling that many treasured this collective coming together right at a moment where lots of uncertainties were looming. But over time I’ve felt a sort of online-attrition set in and I wonder if people now would just feel exhausted by _another_ chat interface and _another_ online event/lecture/meetup etc...</span>

<span style="color: DarkOliveGreen">But to answer the question I probably would have not made it an online event at all. Maybe rather an invitation to not stare at a laptop-screen for 10 hours and go somewhere else instead.</span>

![Description of image here](/img/bleibgesundoderso.png)

<span style="color: DarkOliveGreen">Vodafone carrier message on a Nokia 6320i mobile phone, and I can’t turn this off so I have to stare at it whenever I need to use the phone</span>

<span style="color: Coral">OH!!</span>

<span style="color: CornflowerBlue">Ah yes, true - one of the things we picked up was that everywhere this ‘stay healthy/bleib gesund’ cropped up. I remember an angry post on an email list from the political left where someone wrote: can you just shut up, i am not healthy and have never been, i am dealing with chronic diseases so just think for a moment what kind of interpellation your ableist thoughtlessness produces for me. (hehe editors will you accept ‘interpellation’?)</span>

<span style="color: CornflowerBlue">Another important impulse for me was to cook up something where people can come together - and also get a sense of togetherness - at least for a short moment in time... Remember that we chose Jonathan xxx’s ‘I am dancing in a Lesbian Bar’, and did this also in a melancholy mode, to at least have a representation/imagination of a queer Bar in our space: and this in a situation where it was also clear that queer spaces will be amongst the hardest hit contexts, with regard to economic survival; and where physical distancing and lockdowns also meant that I  for more than 6 weeks, other than doing grocery shopping, would meet no other body but this one friend and his dog, who live down the road, for occasional ‘Spaziergänge’. (Here a link to Tom Holert’s Spaziergänge als zeitgenössischtes soziales Medium). This situation of physical isolation has changed. But also, the sense of enormous urgency, I think, changed - and i am not sure if that is such a good thing. </span>

<span style="color: Coral">I was thinking what you both say on online spaces too. I am a person who likes to meet online and has no problem with it, even I wouldn’t do it online, if it was now. I feel like a canon emerged of these online meetings and it is not something which I pay attention to or enthusiastic about, anymore, unlike in the beginning. Also for a short time I started to think I can join now any other online event all over the world, so I joined a few, one in London. I felt quite uncomfortable, almost like an alien. I didn’t understand the language of the people who are native English speakers and even the contexts, so what once seemed to be great opportunity turned out to be existing just in theory.  </span>

<span style="color: DarkOliveGreen">I’m thinking a bit about the form of our blob and I’m wondering if we could keep the color coding of our different voices and not add our names in front of it like I’d imagine and interview/script to do. I like keeping a bit of the vagueness and fuzziness, maybe a bit of Kollektivkörper? Do we even want to keep it in some dialogue format... I haven’t thought about this yet...</span>

<span style="color: CornflowerBlue">finde ich auch. kann für mich auch einfach mit verschiedenen farben sein.</span>

<span style="color: Coral">maybe there could be more colors than we are :) </span>
