Blurb: 
This podcast content emerged from a lab named “Social Distancing in times of Social Media”. This lab took place on the 12th of May, 2020 in the realm of an interdiciplinary project called Re:coding Algorithmic Culture, funded by the Volkswagen Foundation and organized by the sociology of diversity department at the University of Kassel. In this podcast, we, as the lab organizers, discuss what “social distancing” from a sociological perspective means and why a medical prevention strategy against the Covid-19 pandemic was named like this by the medical experts. We will also talk about how social distancing as a measure got adapted in the discourses of governmental politics during the pandemic, what are the impacts of these discourses on our “social” lives with regard to the question of race, gender, and class. 
 
This podcast is bilingual, in English and in German, and it is recorded on the 4th of January 2021 on a virtual online platform.

This is a message that Vodaphone sent to my Nokia 6320i mobile phone,
and I can't turn this off so I have to stare at it whenever I need to
use the phone.
