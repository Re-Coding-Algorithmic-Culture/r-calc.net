This podcast content emerged from a lab named “Social Distancing in times of Social Media”. This lab took place on the 12th of May, 2020 in the realm of an interdiciplinary project called Re:coding Algorithmic Culture, funded by the Volkswagen Foundation and organized by the sociology of diversity department at the University of Kassel. In this podcast, we, as the lab organizers, discuss what “social distancing” from a sociological perspective means and why a medical prevention strategy against the Covid-19 pandemic was named like this by the medical experts. We will also talk about how social distancing as a measure got adapted in the discourses of governmental politics during the pandemic, what are the impacts of these discourses on our “social” lives with regard to the question of race, gender, and class. 
 
This podcast is bilingual, in English and in German, and it is recorded on the 4th of January 2021 on a virtual online platform.

Pınar:

I would like to talk a little bit about the historical and conceptual background of the phrase "social distancing". I think this concept entered our lives with the pandemic around February maybe even March, right? And we pretty quickly adopted and integrated it in our so-called new normal. This was also the topic of a project lab that we organized in May 2020. 

In the context of this lab, I presented  the conceptual footsteps of ‘social distancing’ that I traced in different resources. That is to say, I looked at how this phrase entered our life in the midst of the pandemic and where it actually comes from. So, I started first looking in the medical papers that dealt with the non-formositicil prevention strategies against the spread of contagious diseases. For today, I can characterize three different aspects of how ‘social distancing’ was used in those papers.

First, the term was used as one of the most effective non-pharmaceutical measures against a pandemic that particularly spreads through respiratory systems, which makes sense, because a spread of a disease becomes a pandemic when there are no medical treatments available at hand and it can take a very long to find an effective medical treatment. That’s why, the medical papers that I looked at were largely focusing on non-medical measures that can be installed until the treatment is available and becomes reachable for everyone. So, in this sense, the term social was used to refer to the institutions or public places that have potential to bring people together in masses or as a group. Therefore, these papers defined the closures of public spaces such as schools, kinder gardens, bars, theaters, libraries as one of the first steps of social distancing. So the first characteristic of it was that it refers to the public space and to the institutions that give public services, which could be also called, in my opinion, as “social gathering restrictions.” 

And the second characteristic was referring to a more private space and relations. Because social distancing, in this context, was also seen as a prevention of a bodily interaction between people, like hugging, hand-shaking, face to face chatting, so it was more about physical proximity and interactions between individuals, which could be also called, in my opinion, only as physical distancing.

But, it sounded to me like in these papers, the term social distancing was used in order to blend these two aspects that is social gathering restrictions and physical distancing, that is the social from “social gathering restriction” and distancing from “physical distancing,” and put them together in a single phrase, social distancing. Of course this is an interpretation.

This interpretation however brings me to the third and the last characteristic of this term, today I would like to highlight. Because it was not evident that ‘social distancing’ was coined by, in and for these medical papers. Because the term was not explained in any place or neither was it given a clear definition, which is quite interesting. Perhaps that is the most interesting aspect for a sociologist, because “social” in sociology has wide ranging definitions, and can mean so many different things by depending on the context. But what is clear for sociology is that social refers to more than pre-given circumstances of life and it is seen as something that is dynamic as it is also about regenerating and recreating human cultural life. It is something pretty alive and one of the most organic parts of the “social” is then human interaction. So that’s why when we hear or rather as a sociologist, when I first heard the term ‘social distancing,’ even I knew that it was employed as a preventive measure for the public health, it nevertheless triggered many sociological questions and concerns in my mind, like from what and how you want to socially distance, what would be the outcome of such prevention for the society? Because although the reason behind it was pretty much clear, the lack of definition made it very hard and problematic to understand why this phrase was chosen. 

And I could also not find answers to this in these medical papers. But what I saw was that despite the lack of definitions and poor contextualization, one could also sense the confidence and insistence, rather, in using ‘social distancing’ in medical context. As if it is such a normal field vocabulary, as if it has always been there. But when I traced it back I found that this term first appeared in the medical field around the 1990s. So, my next question is then where does it come from, that is, what is the origin of this concept?

In his 1925 paper  “Social Distance and its Origin,” Emory Bogardus, who is the founder of one of the first sociology departments in the USA, from the university of southern california, presented his empirical study that he conducted with 248 participants. And he divided the participants into racial categories and looked at which race or races the participants felt closer to or felt socially distant, and tried to understand the reasons behind this by doing random method short interviews with them. What is interesting is not the result of his study per se but in what social segment, which is race, he actually conceptually grounded the origins of social distancing. And that’s why it is also not a surprise one can find the further appearance of this term in some of the very first colonial documents, but also one can today trace social distancing in contemporary social life styles with regard to gender, race and class, so which is very intersectional. And the third one appeared as informal social sanctioning when someone committed a crime or assumed to violate their community's values and norms etc. 

For instance, David Sibley defines the contemporary practice of social distancing, in his article Geographies of Exclusion as follows: Social distancing is "the desire of those who feel threatened to distance themselves from defiled people and defiled places...places associated with ethnic and racial minorities, like the inner city, [that] are still tainted and perceived as polluting in racist discourses, and place-related phobias [that] are similarly evident in response to other minorities, like gays and the homeless" (Sibley, 1995: 49, 59). Or Randall Amster argues in his 2002 article “Patterns of Exclusion: Sanitizing Space, Criminalizing Homelessness” that social distancing operates through the "disease" metaphor and this arises out of spatial segregation of antiseptic sterility and disinfected experience. So according to him it refers to the social sterility particularly in urban spaces as an antiseptic retreat for the diseased of spirit to be temporarily distracted from the depredations of their existence. So, in this sense, he also thinks that it has a burgeoe concerns and it is often subsequently projected on and attributed to some marginalized or colonized "other" (cf. Fanon, 1991). So, in light of the hegemonic nature of social distancing, it is worth considering how this notion of "disease" seems to originate primarily within the dominant culture, and then is projected onto marginalized populations such as the homeless.
So even in a sociological sense, social distancing refers to both affective and physical distancing, like also it is used in these medical papers. But this also suggests that social distancing also is also about spatial segregation and it manifests social hierarchical relations and even reproduces new power structures. Because it also makes clear a control mechanism,  the power of being able to decide, for instance from whom one ones to distance from, who the characteristic of this group, or people, or an individual is and can be defined, that is to say, who decides the cultural and social proximities of such distancing. And I think Eunice will give more concrete and current examples for what I mean by this.
