## About

The project Re:Coding Algorithmic Culture has won a grant from the VW Foundation within the category ‚Original – isn’t it?’. Over the next 1.5 years, the project participants will investigate the question of how algorithmically based collections, classifications and interpretations of data can perpetuate existing social inequalities/ discrimination – and also challenge, if not redefine them. Research formats will be hackathons, game jams, coding workshops, participatory design labs, design noir Experiments, performances, exhibitions as well as video and text analyses. These interdisciplinary labs are meant to be critical, queer-feminist, anti-racist and work with decolonial knowledge in digital-real space. The application was submitted by Sociology of Diversity, University of Kassel, Gender/Diversity in Informatics Systems, University of Kassel and Visual Communiation, Kunsthochschule Kassel. Workers on the project (alphabetically) include: Claude Draude, Elisabeth Tuider, Eunice Njoki, Ipek Burçak, Isabel Paehr, Johanna Schaffer, Loren Britton, Nicole (voec), Pinar Tuzcu and Tom Fixemer.
