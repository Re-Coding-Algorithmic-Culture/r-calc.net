For this website, considerations of accessibility were a core aspect of designing, coding and writing. Our decision to publish our work as a website derives from our wish to contribute to digital spaces with a queer- and transfeminist, antiableist, antiracist perspectives. We present an overview from our public labs, as well as collective and individual research of project participants. This website was made by Nicole (voec), Isabel Paehr, Ipek Burçak, Loren Britton, Johanna Schaffer.
