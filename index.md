# About

This website is a contribution of the academic research project Re:Coding Algorithmic Culture. The project took up its work in October 2019, was funded by the VW Stiftung, and researchers and artists from work groups Visual Communication at the Kunsthochschule Kassel and Sociology of Diversity as well as Gender/ Diversity in Informatics Systems at the University of Kassel, Germany participated.

Initially, we, the project participants planned to investigate the question of how algorithmically based collections, classifications and interpretations of data can perpetuate existing social inequalities/ discrimination – in order to challenge, if not redefine them. But we soon shifted our research attention to experimenting with technological practices and building spaces for collective learning and action. We also put an emphasis on technological metaphors as constitutive for specific realities – for example the metaphor of 'network'. And our project turned towards a much more interventionist dimension, as our conceptual interests grew in disrupting structures of domination that are algorithmically reinforced: we organized public labs that engaged temporality as a dimension of dominance, different network types as performances of governance and autonomy, social distancing in times of social media, file systems as storytelling devices, and game making as playing with rules.
 
For the website, considerations of accessibility were a core aspect of designing, coding and writing. We do however recognize that this is a fine line to walk for a production within hegemonic, european-western academic institutions. Our decision to publish our work as a website derives from our wish to contribute to digital spaces with queer- and transfeminist, antiableist, antiracist perspectives. We present an overview from our public labs, as well as collective and individual research of project participants. 
 The project was funded by the VolkswagenStiftung within the category ‚Original – isn’t it?’. It took place over 18 months, from September 2019 to February 2021, and received a funding of EUR 198 000.- Project Particpants were (alphabetically) Claude Draude, Elisabeth Tuider, Eunice Njoki, Ipek Burçak, Isabel Paehr, Johanna Schaffer, Loren Britton, Nicole spiders, Pinar Tuzcu and Tom Fixemer. The website was designed and developed by Isabel Paehr, Nicole spiders, Ipek Burçak, Loren Britton and Johanna Schaffer.  

The project was prolongued to December 2021 as ‘Re:coding Algorithmic Cultures of the Pandemic – The Example of Social Distancing’. This second installment received EUR 80 100.-, with the participation of (alphabetically) Claude Draude, Elisabeth Tuider, Ipek Burçak, Loren Britton and Pinar Tuzcu.
