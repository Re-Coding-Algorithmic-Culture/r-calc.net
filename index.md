# About

The project Re:Coding Algorithmic Culture was an academic research project in two parts. The first part took place  took place between October 2019 – February 2021. Researchers from Visual Communication at the Kunsthochschule Kassel and Sociology of Diversity and Gender Diversity and Informatics Systems at the University of Kassel participated. Initially, the project participants planned to investigate the question of how algorithmically based collections, classifications and interpretations of data can perpetuate existing social inequalities/ discrimination – in order to challenge, if not redefine them.

For this website, considerations of accessibility were a core aspect of designing, coding and writing. Our decision to publish our work as a website derives from our wish to contribute to digital spaces with a queer- and transfeminist, antiableist, antiracist perspectives. We present an overview from our public labs, as well as collective and individual research of project participants. This website was made by Nicole (voec), Isabel Paehr, Ipek Burçak, Loren Britton, Johanna Schaffer.
